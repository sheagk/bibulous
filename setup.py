A drop-in replacement for BibTeX based on string templates.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Bibulous provides a flexible way of accomplishing the same tasks as BibTeX, and going
beyond it in capability. Some of its advantages include:

  - An integrated BibTeX database file (.bib file) parser.
  - Fully internationalized: Bibulous can use bibliography databases and bibliography style
    files written in any language.
  - Simple and powerful customization: style templates are an ideal way of visualizing and
    manipulating bibliography styles. There is no need to learn BibTeX's arcane stack-based
    language in order to build or customize a bibliography style.
  - Multilingual capability: templates are largely language agnostic, so that multilingual
    bibliographies can be achieved almost effortlessly.
  - Users can build glossaries, lists of symbols, and lists of acronyms using the same
    infrastructure as used for bibliographies.
  - Sorting of citations is fully localized and has no difficulty in dealing with strings
    that contain Unicode, LaTeX-markup characters for non-English languages, or even
    mathematics markup.

This version requires Python 2.7 or later.
